## Executive Summary

**Overall GEO Score: 52/70 (Good - Needs Optimization)**

The DRMN website demonstrates solid foundational GEO elements including comprehensive FAQ sections, structured data markup, and multilingual support. However, significant opportunities exist to improve quotable facts, comparison positioning, and freshness signals to maximize visibility in AI-powered search engines (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, Google AI Overviews).

**Priority Actions:**
1. Add specific, quotable statistics throughout content
2. Create comparison tables vs competitors
3. Add "last updated" dates to pages
4. Include more authority signals (user testimonials, case studies)
5. Create an llms.txt file for better LLM understanding
